To: Graduate Admissions Committee

I am writing this letter to recommend my former student Ajay Singh who is applying for the Master of science (MS) in your school.

I met Ajay in null when he enrolled in my "CS151: Object-Oriented Design" course.

Ajay earned  Afrom this tough course, and this shows how knowledgeable and hard worker he is.
He also earned  A from my CS154: Theory of Computation.

Ajay submitted well-written assignments, participated in all of my class activities.
He was always very passionate, very enthusiastic, punctual.

Furthermore, I noticed from the term project result, he developed leadership, time management, and problem-solving skills. He worked effectively with the team members and delegated tasks appropriately. They were able to deliver a successful project in a timely fashion.

I believe that Ajay has the capacity to excel at higher education program and this is my pleasure to highly recommend him.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.

Very Respectfully,
